`2023.12-2024.8`

I open-sourced the [***stable-fast*** (https://github.com/chengzeyi/stable-fast)](https://github.com/chengzeyi/stable-fast) inference performance optimization framework on ***GitHub***. This project is effective for optimizing ***HuggingFace Diffusers*** and has got over ***1000+ stars***. It is currently under active development and support for other implementations of stable diffusion is coming soon.

I also develop and maintain AIGC related inference performance optimization for SiliconFlow, including ***OneDiff*** and other projects, which achieve the best performance over all other implementations.

Now I am focusing on the development of a new acceleration framework called ***xelerate*** that utilizes the latest NVIDIA CUDA hardware features and PyTorch 2.0 APIs.
This framework can achieve peak performance on NVIDIA A100, H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs and support a wide range of optimization techniques, including INT8 and FP8 quantization,
and is expected to work seamlessly with some new models like ***FLUX***, ***CogVideoX*** and ***SD3***.
On a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, it can reduce the inference time of ***FLUX.1-dev*** for generating a single 1024x1024 image with 28 steps to 2.7 seconds,
while keeping nearly the same quality and having complete support for dynamic shape and dynamic LoRA switching.
Even on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, it can achieve a inference speed of 6.1s per 1024x1024 image with 28 steps for ***FLUX.1-dev***.

Some key features of ***xelerate*** include:

- __A Fast Flash Attention Implementation__: This is my own implementation of ***Flash Attention*** that can achieve the best performance over all other implementations. It can outperform Dao Lab's original Flash Attention 2 implementation by at most 2x on RTX 4090 and A100.
- __Full Dynamic Shape Support__: ***xelearte*** can support dynamic shape inference out of the box, and adapt quickly to different input shapes within a few milliseconds, while TensorRT can take more than ten seconds.
- __Minimum Cold Start Time__: ***xelerate*** can compile a model and start inference within 10 seconds with the help of a efficient cache mechanism, while TensorRT can take more than 30 seconds.
- __A Complete Set of Quantization Techniques__: ***xelerate*** supports a wide range of quantization techniques, including INT8 and FP8 quantization, and is very easy to use and adjust.

Primarily responsible for inference performance optimization and the development and maintenance of the Quark Intelligent Scanner project, aiming to tap into the expansive camera scanner application market. Our project employs complex deep learning models on cloud servers, distinguishing us from competitors deploying traditional computer vision algorithms locally on smartphones.

Our system mainly focuses on optimizing the TorchScript Engine, a promising deployment and optimization technique I identified two years ago. I've implemented GPU-accelerated image preprocessing, post-processing algorithms, and traditional CV image processing algorithms. After continuous enhancements emphasizing operator fusion, graph rewriting, and memory optimization, it has become stable and efficient.

I developed the ***ICE*** computational acceleration framework, which has significantly accelerated computations for Quark's online inference services. The ICE framework integrates various techniques, such as:

- __Rapid Tracing__: In PyTorch 1, model hooking achieves JIT tracing capabilities similar to torch.compile, converting code needing optimization into TorchScript format efficiently and supporting training acceleration.
- __TorchScript Graph IR Pass__: Automates computation optimizations, mainly operator fusion and replacement.
- __High-Performance Fusion Operator Library__: Implemented a series of high-performance fusion operators based on CUDNN, CUBLAS, CUDA C++, and OpenAI Triton. These operators support both forward and backward propagation, thus can also accelerate training.
- __CUDA Graph Capture, Optimized BeamSearch, Optimized Attention Layer, etc.__, further enhanced performance when combined with the aforementioned technologies.

Currently, the ICE acceleration framework has significantly accelerated models like Transformer OCR, Swin Transformer, NAFNET, Swin2SR, RealESRGAN, etc.

Recently, we aim to make a business breakthrough in the AIGC domain with the ***Stable Diffusion*** model. This project requires on-the-fly fine-tuning of the base model using personalized sample images uploaded by users, followed by extensive inference predictions. Presently, leveraging the ICE engine, I achieved an inference performance of ***60 it/s*** on NVIDIA A100 for Stable Diffusion v1.5 (512x512 resolution), delivering images in half a second, and it's compatible with ControlNet, LORA, and other...

Given our high expenditure on GPU-intensive computations, cost optimization is crucial. Our system processes over 10 million user-uploaded document images daily with fewer than 200 GPU cards, generating considerable profit. As our competitors continue to struggle with inefficient systems, their users are gradually transitioning to our product.

__Senior Software Engineer, Alibaba Group__

`2021-2022`

I was responsible for developing and maintaining our OCR and image document format restoration services. I designed an XML document format protocol for the Quark browser and, utilizing my understanding of graph algorithms from discrete mathematics, researched an algorithm to restore EXCEL table structures for our WORD/EXCEL structural restoration product. Though this system is still under active development, I transitioned roles to focus on other priorities.

Additionally, I developed a framework to integrate models into the Quark browser. This framework allows developers to write model invocation code once and deploy it across multiple platforms like cloud servers, desktops, and smartphones, each interfacing with distinct inference acceleration frameworks. This framework has facilitated over half of the client-side ML projects in the Quark browser.

I inherited a poorly maintained GPU-based video encoding and decoding framework. Recognizing its limitations, I decided to completely rewrite the system. By studying NVIDIA CUDA programming documentation and prominent video codec frameworks like FFmpeg, I redesigned the API and data structures, rigorously testing for performance and format compatibility. This system efficiently utilizes NVCODEC for acceleration and switches to other implementations when compatibility is required. The project's rewrite pr...

Additionally, I wrote native C++ code, invoking MNN to deploy compact ML models and implemented CV algorithms in the Quark browser.
